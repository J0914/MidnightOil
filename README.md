## Dashboard

Once logged in, you are redirected to the dashboard. The dashboard holds the most recent notes from your most recently created notebook and your most recently created decks. If you scroll to the bottom of the page there is a study beats button and you can listen to some of the developers favorite study music! (future features include embedding your own youtube videos to create your own playlist)

## Notebooks

If you click on the notebooks dropdown, you can see a list of the notebooks you've created and all notes inside of them. You can create a new notebooks, edit a notebooks title, or delete a notebook from this location as well. If you create a new notebook, it takes you to a page with a new note. You can then edit the title or body of that note using MarkDown syntax. The editor has a lot of great features. Check them out!
